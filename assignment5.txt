ASSIGNMENT 2
DAY 3


1.VAR
 
  
   * The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, 
     we can initialize the value of that variable.
   * It is a globle variable.
   * Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
   * The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.
   * The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.

   *Example: var a =10;

  PROGRAM

  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Assignment 2</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <script>
       var a =10;
       console.log(a);  
       if(true)
        {
         var a=20;
         console.log(a); 
        }
       console.log(a);  
   </script>
   </body>
   </html>



2. LET


   * The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. 
   * It is a local variable.
   * It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.
   * The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited
     to the block on which it is used.
   * It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.
   * Example: let a =10;

 
   PROGRAM

   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Assignment 2</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   <script>
       {
       let a =10;
       console.log(a); 
       if(true)
         {
          let a=20;
          console.log(a); 
         }
       }
       console.log(a); 
   </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   


3.CONST 
   

   * const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. 
   * The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

   
   *Example: const a =10;

  PROGRAM

   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Assignment 2</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   <script>
       const MY_VARIABLE =10;
       console.log(MY_VARIABLE);
   </script>
   </body>
   </html>
